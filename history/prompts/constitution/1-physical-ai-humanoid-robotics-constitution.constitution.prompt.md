**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Date when constitution was originally adopted | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-12

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created a constitution for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook project with 6 core principles, scope, educational goals and governance guidelines.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests needed for constitution creation.
- 📁 Files: Modified .specify/memory/constitution.md with the new content.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation of textbook features based on this constitution.
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution effectively captures the project's requirements and provides a clear framework for future development.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution creation prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing the first feature based on the established constitution
