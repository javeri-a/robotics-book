# Simulation Setup

This section helps you set up the simulation environments used throughout the textbook.

## Gazebo Simulation

Gazebo is a robotics simulator that provides high-fidelity physics, visual rendering, and sensor simulation. It's used extensively in robotics research and development.

### Installation

Install Gazebo Garden or Fortress following the installation guide at: https://gazebosim.org/docs

## Unity Robotics

Unity provides a powerful simulation environment with advanced graphics and physics simulation capabilities. It's particularly useful for testing perception systems and human-robot interaction.

### Installation

1. Download Unity Hub
2. Install Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
3. Add the Robotics package through Unity's Package Manager

## Verification

After installing your chosen simulation environment, verify it works by running a basic simulation example.

## Next Steps

Once your simulation environment is set up, you can proceed to the simulation modules in the textbook.
