# ROS 2 Basics

This section covers the essential ROS 2 concepts you'll need for the textbook modules.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous, goal-oriented communication patterns

## Installation

Follow the official ROS 2 installation guide for your operating system. We recommend ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (Ubuntu 22.04) or the latest Rolling release.

## Next Steps

After installing ROS 2, familiarize yourself with the core concepts through the practical exercises in Module 1.
