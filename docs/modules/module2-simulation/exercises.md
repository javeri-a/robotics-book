# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Gazebo Robot Simulation

Create a simulation of a simple robot in Gazebo that can navigate a predefined path.

### Requirements:
- Create a URDF model of a differential drive robot
- Set up a Gazebo world with obstacles
- Implement navigation to follow a path
- Log the robot's trajectory and performance metrics

## Exercise 2: Unity Perception Simulation

Create a Unity scene with a robot that uses computer vision to navigate.

### Requirements:
- Set up Unity with the Perception package
- Create a scene with objects to detect
- Implement object detection using synthetic data
- Connect to ROS 2 for control commands

## Exercise 3: Simulation Comparison

Implement the same robot control task in both Gazebo and Unity.

### Requirements:
- Create identical robot models in both simulators
- Implement the same control algorithm
- Compare performance metrics between simulators
- Analyze differences in simulation results
