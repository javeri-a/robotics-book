# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This repository contains a comprehensive textbook covering Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, designed to connect digital AI algorithms with real robotic systems. The content includes theoretical knowledge and practical implementation strategies.

## Overview

This textbook covers the essential components of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding the communication backbone of robotic systems
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Simulation environments for robotics development
- **Module 3**: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Processing and decision-making systems
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Integrating perception, communication, and action
- **Module 5**: Capstone Project - Building a complete voice-driven humanoid robot

## Target Audience

- University-level students learning robotics and AI
- Instructors building modern robotics curricula
- Engineering teams evaluating embodied AI skills

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python and C++)
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of fundamental AI and robotics concepts
